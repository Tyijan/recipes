2 tbsp olive oil
plus a little for the dish
750g lean beef mince
90g pack prosciutto

half quantity of our tomato sauce (see the recipe), or 800g passata
200ml hot beef stock
a little grated nutmeg

300g pack fresh lasagne sheets
half quantity of our white sauce (see the recipe), or 520g ready-made sauce
125g ball mozzarella, torn into thin strips



To make the meat sauce, heat the oil in a frying pan and cook the beef in two batches for about 10 mins until browned all over. Finely chop 4 slices of prosciutto, then stir through the meat mixture.

Pour over our basic tomato sauce and stock, add the nutmeg, then season. Bring up to the boil, then simmer for 30 mins until the sauce looks rich.

Heat oven to 180C/fan/160C/gas 4. Lightly oil an ovenproof dish (about 30 x 20cm). Spoon one third of the meat sauce into the dish, then cover with lasagne sheets. Drizzle over about one quarter of our classic white sauce.

Repeat until you have 3 layers of pasta. Cover with the remaining white sauce, making sure you canÅft see any pasta poking through.

Scatter the mozzarella over the top. Arrange the rest of the prosciutto on top. Bake for 45 mins until the top is bubbling and lightly browned.
